===========
This is currently a magic number / magic moves generator for chess move generation (written summer 2014). Hopefully I will expand the project into a full-fledged chess engine in Haskell in the near future. Some changing of the code's organization is needed going forward.

The move generator takes a few minutes to generate magic numbers each time it starts up. This can be avoided by storing the list magic numbers between runs and simply regenerating lookup tables each run. I have code to do this in my Reversi engine. I will merge it here "soon".

Anyone may use this code for any purpose. Not guaranteed correct.
